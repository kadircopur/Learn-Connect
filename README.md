2. Enable iOS integration and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.  
3. Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the root directory of your project.  
4. Modify the app's `App` file to initialize Firebase:  

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Firebase

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                   didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
    FirebaseApp.configure()
    return true
  }
}

@main
struct LearnConnectApp: App {

    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var delegate

    init() {
        FirebaseApp.configure()
    }
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture and Technologies Used

### Architecture

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**  
  The application employs MVVM architecture to ensure separation of concerns and better testability.  
  - **ViewModels** handle business logic and state management.
  - **Views** are responsible for user interaction and UI rendering.

### Technologies

- **SwiftUI:** A declarative UI framework for building the application interface.  
- **SwiftData:** Used for managing local data persistence and complex relationships.  
- **Firebase Authentication:** Handles user registration, login, and session management.  
- **Asynchronous:** Simplifies asynchronous tasks like API requests.  
- **HLS Video Streaming:** Ensures high-quality and efficient video playback for courses.  
- **AppStorage:** Manages user settings like dark mode preferences locally.
